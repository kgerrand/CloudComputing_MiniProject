This project was set as part of my final year module, 'Special Core in Software Engineering and High Performance Computing'.
The aim of this project is to create a package to process data from the ATLAS experiment (https://cds.cern.ch/record/2707171) using cloud technology. This work is based on an existing notebook that walks the user through the steps to rediscover the Higgs boson. This is shown in this repository (HZZAnalysis_initial.ipynb), but can also be found at https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/blob/master/13-TeV-examples/uproot_python/HZZAnalysis.ipynb.
